# About the author.

My name is IÃ±aki. I'm a student of System Engineering. This is my first Java project.

During my career, in the *Databases I* subject, I worked with an overcomplicated and not too well-worked software
made in 2016 by other students of the career. Crashes and low performance motivated me to create an application which
could achieve that purpose in a better way.
