# About the author

My name is IÃ±aki. I'm a student of System Engineering. This is my first Java project.

During my career, in the Database I subject, I worked with an over-complicated and not too well-working software
made in 2016 by other students of the career. That's the reason why I decided to create an improved version of that
application.
